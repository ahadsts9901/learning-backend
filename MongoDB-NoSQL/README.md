## Overview of MongoDB and the Document Model

In this unit, you learned about the relationship between MongoDB and Atlas. MongoDB is a general-purpose database that can be used for a variety of use cases. It’s part of Atlas, the developer data platform. You also learned about the MongoDB document model. Specifically, you learned about these key features:

- Data is organized into documents, collections, and databases.
- Documents are stored in BSON, which supports a large range of data types, including all JSON data types, dates, numbers, and ObjectIds.
- Every document requires an \_id field, which acts as a primary key or unique identifier. If an inserted document doesn’t have an \_id field, MongoDB automatically generates one.
- MongoDB has a flexible schema, which means that documents with different structures can be stored in the same collection.
