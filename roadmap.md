# Backend Development with Node.js Roadmap

1. What is Node.js?

1. Difference between browser JavaScript and Node JavaScript.
1. What are the built-in core modules of Node.js? Discuss each one individually.
1. Difference between require and import. Discuss the syntax.
1. Create a simple server using only HTTP methods without using Express.js. Create GET & POST APIs and perform some actions.
1. Install the Express.js library and perform the same task as in the HTTP server. Discuss the Express.js framework and explain how it reduces the amount of code needed.
1. Explain Express.js routes and how they work in a hierarchy.
1. Install complete MongoDB with MongoDB Compass. Show how to create a MongoDB database and explain what MongoDB Compass is.
1. Install Mongoose. Explain the relationship between Mongoose and MongoDB. Discuss NoSQL and SQL. Moreover, discuss ODM and ORM and explain their differences.
1. Provide a detailed explanation of the Mongoose schema, how it functions, and what should be taken into consideration. Explain normalization and how to create a database schema. Additionally, provide some references to enable students to learn on their own.
1. Create a new server, interact with MongoDB, and build something like a to-do app server.
1. Install JWT and explain how it works.
1. Install a bucket library and demonstrate how to upload files and images.
1. Install bcrypt and explain hashing in detail.
1. Discuss the event loop and explain how Node.js works internally.
1. Discuss threading.

These are the core modules for a backend developer pursuing a career in backend development. I might be wrong, but I'm providing a roadmap and playlist that will help students. Remember, consistency is a must. Never depend on someone else. Choose your own path. If you want to stand out, you have to work hard without watching the clock. Best of luck!
